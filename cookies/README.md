    - [Get cookies.txt (Firefox Extension)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)
2. **Encoding Encode it to base64 if using basteBin** :
    - This ensure safety and reliability.
    - The sites like basteBin anyone can access any data.
    - This is only to be done while uploding the cookies to basteBin and then adding it to config.
    - Dont do this if you are directky adding to cookies directly.
